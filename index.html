    <h2>About</h2>
    <p><strong>Spatial Analytica</strong> is a geospatial design and urban innovation consultancy founded by Dr. Jorge Sainz de Aja, an urban computation expert with a robust background in architecture and urban design. With over a decade of experience as a practicing urban designer, Jorge brings a deep understanding of spatial, social, and regulatory dynamics into data-driven processes — positioning Spatial Analytica at the intersection of design thinking and computational strategy.</p>
    <p>The company bridges traditional urban design expertise with advanced spatial analytics, using data science to inform master planning, policy development, and public engagement. With international experience across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East — including collaborations with the Asian Development Bank, Grimshaw Architects, McGregor Coxall, and public sector institutions — Spatial Analytica integrates computational urbanism with actionable insights.</p>
    <p>Specialities include geospatial modelling, digital twins, KPI-based evaluation, generative design tools, and interactive platforms that support more livable, resilient, and equitable cities.</p>

        <h3>Innovating Resilience: A New Framework for the Future</h3>
        <p>We have developed an innovative <strong>Community Flood Resilience Framework</strong> to transform how communities adapt to groundwater flooding. Built from the ground up, this pioneering approach fuses data, local knowledge, and forward-thinking strategies into a practical, scalable system. Through our three dynamic phases — <em>Discovery, Evaluation, and Socialisation</em> — we unlock measurable insights across five key resilience areas: infrastructure, environment, economy, institutions, and society. Designed to be adaptable and community-led, the framework provides a powerful tool for tracking progress, guiding investment, and accelerating resilience in a changing climate.</p>
